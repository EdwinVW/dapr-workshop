# Assignment 1 - Run the application

In this assignment, you'll run the application to make sure everything works correctly.

## Assignment goals

To complete this assignment, you must reach the following goals:

- All services are running.
- The logging indicates that all services are working correctly.

As a reminder, this is how the services will interact with each other:

## Step 1. Run the VehicleRegistration service

1. Open the `java` folder in VS Code. This guide assumes VS Code, but feel free to use an editor or IDE you're comfortable with.

   > Throughout the assignment you can execute all steps in the same instance of editor or IDE window.

1. Open a terminal window.

   > You can do this by using the hotkey ``Ctrl-` `` (Windows) or ``Shift-Ctrl-` `` (macOS).

1. Make sure the current folder is `java/VehicleRegistrationService`.

1. Start the service using `mvn spring-boot:run`.

> If you receive an error here, please double-check whether or not you have installed all the [prerequisites](../README.md#Prerequisites) for the workshop!

Now you can test whether you can call the VehicleRegistrationService. You can do this using a browser, cURL or some other HTTP client. But there is a convenient way of testing RESTful APIs directly from VS Code (this uses the REST Client extension VS Code):

1. Open the file `java/VehicleRegistrationService/test.http` in your editor. The request in this file simulates retrieving the vehicle- and owner information for a certain license-number.

1. Click on `Send request` in the file to send a request to the API:

   ![REST client](img/rest-client.png)
   
1. The response of the request will be shown in a separate window on the right. It should be a response with HTTP status code `200 OK` and the body should contain some random vehicle and owner-information:

   ```json
   HTTP/1.1 200 
   Connection: keep-alive
   Content-Type: application/json
   Date: Wed, 16 Jun 2021 19:39:05 GMT
   Keep-Alive: timeout=60
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked
   
   {
       "vehicleId": "KZ-49-VX",
       "brand": "Toyota",
       "model": "Rav 4",
       "ownerName": "Angelena Fairbairn",
       "ownerEmail": "angelena.fairbairn@outlook.com"
   }
   ```

1. Check the logging in the terminal window. It should look like this:

   ![VehicleRegistrationService logging](img/logging-vehicleregistrationservice-java.png)

## Step 2. Run the FineCollection service

1. Make sure the VehicleRegistrationService service is running (result of step 1).

1. Open a **new** terminal window in VS Code.

   > You can do this by using the hotkey (``Ctrl-` `` on Windows, ``Shift-Ctrl-` `` on macOS) or clicking on the `+` button in the terminal window title bar:  
   > ![](img/terminal-new-java.png)

1. Make sure the current folder is `java/FineCollectionService`.

1. Start the service using `mvn spring-boot:run`.

1. Open the file `src/FineCollectionService/test.http` in VS Code. The request in this file simulates sending a detected speeding-violation to the FineCollectionService.

1. Click on `Execute request` in the file to send a request to the API.

1. The response of the request will be shown in a separate window on the right. It should be a response with HTTP status code `200 OK` and no body.

1. Check the logging in the terminal window. It should look like this:

   ![FineCollectionService logging](img/logging-finecollectionservice-java.png)

## Step 3. Run the TrafficControl service

1. Make sure the VehicleRegistrationService and FineCollectionService are running (results of step 1 and 2).

1. Open a **new** terminal window in VS Code and make sure the current folder is `java/TrafficControlService`.

1. Start the service using `mvn spring-boot:run`.

1. Open the `src/TrafficControlService/traffic-control.http` file in VS Code.

1. Click on `Execute request` for all three requests in the file to send two requests to the API.

1. The response of the requests will be shown in a separate window on the right. Both requests should yield a response with HTTP status code `200 OK` and no body.

1. Check the logging in the terminal window. It should look like this:

   ![TrafficControlService logging](img/logging-trafficcontrolservice-java.png)

1. Also inspect the logging of the FineCollectionService.

   > You can select another terminal window by clicking on it in the **tabs view** on the right side of the terminal window:  
   > ![](img/terminal-tabs-java.png)

   You should see the speeding-violation being handled by the FineCollectionService:

   ![FineCollectionService logging](img/logging-finecollectionservice-java.png)

## Step 4. Run the simulation

You've tested the APIs directly by using a REST client. Now you're going to run the simulation that actually simulates cars driving on the highway. The simulation will simulate 3 entry- and exit-cameras (one for each lane).

1. Open a new terminal window in VS Code and make sure the current folder is `java/Simulation`.

1. Start the service using `mvn spring-boot:run`.

1. In the simulation window you should see something like this:

   ![](img/logging-simulation-java.png)

1. Also check the logging in all the other Terminal windows. You should see all entry- and exit events and any speeding-violations that were detected in the logging.

Now we know the application runs correctly. It's time to start adding Dapr to the application.

## Next assignment

Make sure you stop all running processes and close all the terminal windows in VS Code before proceeding to the next assignment. Stopping a service or the simulation is done by pressing `Ctrl-C` in the terminal window. To close the terminal window, enter the `exit` command.
