# Assignment 2 - Add Dapr service-to-service invocation

## Assignment goals

To complete this assignment, you must reach the following goals:

- The VehicleRegistrationService and FineCollectionService are both running with a Dapr sidecar.
- The FineCollectionService uses the Dapr service invocation building block to call the `/vehicleinfo/{licensenumber}` endpoint on the VehicleRegistrationService.

This assignment targets number **1** in the end-state setup:

## Step 1: Start the VehicleRegistrationService with Dapr

In assignment 1, you started all the services using `dotnet run`. When you want to run a service with a Dapr sidecar that handles its communication, you need to start it using the Dapr CLI. There are a couple of things you need to specify when starting the service:

- The service needs a unique id which Dapr can use to find it. This is called the *app-id* (or application Id). You specify this with the `--app-id` flag on the command-line.

- Each of the services listens on a different HTTP port for requests (to prevent port collisions on localhost). The VehicleRegistrationService runs on port `6002` for instance. You need to tell Dapr this port so the Dapr sidecar can communicate with the service. You specify this with the `--app-port` flag on the command-line.

- The service can use HTTP or gRPC to communicate with the Dapr sidecar. By default these ports are `3500` and `50001`. But to prevent confusion, you'll use totally different port numbers in the assignments. To prevent port collisions on the local machine when running multiple services, you have to specify a unique HTTP and gRPC port per service. You specify this with the `--dapr-http-port` and `--dapr-grpc-port` flags on the command-line. Throughout the workshop, you will use the following ports:

  | Service                    | Application Port | Dapr sidecar HTTP port | Dapr sidecar gRPC port |
  | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | TrafficControlService      | 6000             | 3600                   | 60000                  |
  | FineCollectionService      | 6001             | 3601                   | 60001                  |
  | VehicleRegistrationService | 6002             | 3602                   | 60002                  |

- Finally you need to tell Dapr how to start the service. The services are .NET services which can be started with the command `dotnet run`.

You will use the `run` command of the Dapr CLI and specify all the options above on the command-line:

1. Make sure you have started Docker Desktop on your machine and the Dapr CLI and runtime are installed (see the [prerequisites](../README.md#prerequisites)).

2. Open the `src` folder in this repo in VS Code.

3. Open the terminal window in VS Code and make sure the current folder is `src/VehicleRegistrationService`.

4. Enter the following command to run the VehicleRegistrationService with a Dapr sidecar:

   ```console
   dapr run --app-id vehicleregistrationservice --app-port 6002 --dapr-http-port 3602 --dapr-grpc-port 60002 dotnet run
   ```

5. Check the logs for any errors. As you can see, both Dapr as well as application logging is shown as output.

Now you're running a 'Daprized' version of the VehicleRegistrationService. As you might have noticed, you didn't need to change any code for this to work. The VehicleRegistrationService is still just a web API listening for requests. Only now, you've started it with a Dapr sidecar next to it that can communicate with it. This means other services can use Dapr to call this service. This is what you'll do in the next step.

## Step 2: Call the VehicleRegistrationService using Dapr service invocation

In this step, you're going to change the code of the FineCollectionService so it uses Dapr service invocation to call the VehicleRegistrationService.

First you're going to change the code so it calls the Dapr sidecar:

1. Open the file `src/FineCollectionService/Controllers/CollectionController.cs` in VS Code.

1. Inspect the `CollectFine` method. It contains a call to the VehicleRegistrationService to retrieve the vehicle info:

   ```csharp
   // get owner info
   var vehicleInfo = await _vehicleRegistrationService.GetVehicleInfo(speedingViolation.VehicleId);
   ```

   The `_vehicleRegistrationService` is an instance of a proxy that uses the .NET `HttpClient` to call the VehicleRegistrationService. You are going to change that proxy so it uses Dapr service invocation.

1. Open the file `src/FineCollectionService/Proxies/VehicleRegistrationService.cs` in VS Code.

1. Inspect the `GetVehicleInfo` method. You can see that in the HTTP call, the URL of the VehicleRegistrationService (running on port 6002) is used.

1. The API for calling the Dapr service invocation building block on a Dapr sidecar is:

   ```http
   http://localhost:<daprPort>/v1.0/invoke/<appId>/method/<method-name>
   ```

   You can substitute the placeholders in this URL with the appropriate values so the FineCollectionService's sidecar can call the the VehicleRegistrationService, this yields the following URL:

   ```http
   http://localhost:3601/v1.0/invoke/vehicleregistrationservice/method/vehicleinfo/{licenseNumber}
   ```

   As you can see in this URL, the FineCollectionService's Dapr sidecar will run on HTTP port `3601`.

1. Replace the URL in the code with the new Dapr service invocation URL. The code should now look like this:

   ```csharp
   public async Task<VehicleInfo> GetVehicleInfo(string licenseNumber)
   {
       return await _httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<VehicleInfo>(
           $"http://localhost:3601/v1.0/invoke/vehicleregistrationservice/method/vehicleinfo/{licenseNumber}");
   }
   ```

   > It's important to really grasp the sidecar pattern used by Dapr. In this case, the FineCollectionService calls the VehicleRegistrationService by **calling its own Dapr sidecar**! The FineCollectionService doesn't need to know anymore where the VehicleRegistrationService lives because its Dapr sidecar will take care of that. It will find it based on the `app-id` specified in the URL and call the target service's sidecar.

1. Open a **new** terminal window in VS Code and make sure the current folder is `src/FineCollectionService`.

1. Check all your code-changes are correct by building the code:

   ```console
   dotnet build
   ```

   If you see any warnings or errors, review the previous steps to make sure the code is correct.

1. Enter the following command to run the FineCollectionService with a Dapr sidecar:

   ```console
   dapr run --app-id finecollectionservice --app-port 6001 --dapr-http-port 3601 --dapr-grpc-port 60001 dotnet run
   ```

1. Check the logs for any errors. As you can see, both Dapr as well as application logging is shown as output.

Now you're going to test the application:

1. Open a **new** terminal window in VS Code and change the current folder to `src/TrafficControlService`.

1. Enter the following command to run the TrafficControlService:

1. ```console
   dotnet run
   ```

> The TrafficControlService does not need to run with a Dapr sidecar in this assignment. This is because it will still call the FineCollectionService over HTTP as before.

The services are up & running. Now you're going to test this using the simulation.

1. Open a **new** terminal window in VS Code and change the current folder to `src/Simulation`.

1. Start the simulation:

   ```console
   dotnet run
   ```

You should see similar logging as before when you ran the application. So all the functionality works the same, but now you use Dapr service invocation to communicate between the FineCollectionService and the VehicleRegistrationService.

## Step 3: Use Dapr service invocation with the Dapr SDK for .NET

In this step, you're going to change the code of the FineCollectionService so it uses the Dapr SDK for .NET to call the VehicleRegistrationService. The SDK provides a more integrated way to invoke the Dapr sidecar API.

First stop the simulation:

1. Open the terminal window in VS Code in which the Camera Simulation runs.

1. Stop the simulation by pressing `Ctrl-C` and close the terminal window by clicking the trashcan icon in its title bar (or typing the `exit` command).

1. Open the terminal window in VS Code in which the FineCollectionService runs.

1. Stop the service by pressing `Ctrl-C`. Keep this terminal window open and focused.

1. Add a reference to the Dapr ASP.NET Core integration library:

   ```console
   dotnet add package Dapr.AspNetCore -v 1.2.0
   ```

   > The `Dapr.AspNetCore` package contains the `DaprClient` class used to directly invoke the Dapr API as well as additional integrations with ASP.NET Core. Because the services are all ASP.NET Core web APIs, we'll use this package throughout the workshop.

Now you'll change the code to use the Dapr SDK `HttpClient` integration to call the VehicleRegistrationService. The `HttpClient` integration allows you to keep using the regular `HttpClient` to make service calls, while the SDK ensures that calls are routed through the Dapr sidecar.

1. Open the file `src/FineCollectionService/Startup.cs` in VS Code.

1. Add a using statement in this file to make sure you can use the Dapr client:

   ```csharp
   using Dapr.Client;
   ```

1. The `ConfigureServices` method, contains these two lines of code which register the .NET `HttpClient` and the `VehicleRegistrationService`  proxy (which uses the `HttpClient`) with dependency injection:

   ```csharp
   // add service proxies
   services.AddHttpClient();
   services.AddSingleton<VehicleRegistrationService>();
   ```

1. Replace these two lines with with the following lines:

   ```csharp
   // add service proxies
   services.AddSingleton<VehicleRegistrationService>(_ => 
       new VehicleRegistrationService(DaprClient.CreateInvokeHttpClient(
           "vehicleregistrationservice", "http://localhost:3601")));
   ```

   As you can see in this snippet, you use the `DaprClient` to create an `HttpClient` instance for doing service invocation. You specify the `app-id` of the service you want to communicate with. You also specify the address of the Dapr sidecar, because the FineCollectionService's sidecar does not use the default Dapr HTTP port (3500). The resulting `HttpClient` instance is explicitly passed into the constructor of the `VehicleRegistrationService` proxy.

   > This is an example of the deep integration of Dapr with ASP.NET Core when you use the `Dapr.AspNetCore` library. You can still use the `HttpClient` (and its rich feature-set) in your code, but under the hood the Dapr service invocation building block is used.

1. Open the file `src/FineCollectionService/Proxies/VehicleRegistrationService.cs` in VS Code.

1. Because the `HttpClient` passed into this class has already been created for a certain `app-id`, you can omit the host information from the request URL. Change the URL that is used in the `GetVehicleInfo` to `/vehicleinfo/{license-number}`. The method should now look like this:

   ```csharp
   public async Task<VehicleInfo> GetVehicleInfo(string licenseNumber)
   {
       return await _httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<VehicleInfo>(
           $"/vehicleinfo/{licenseNumber}");
   }
   ```

Now the FineCollectionService is changed to use the Dapr SDK for service invocation. Let's test this.

1. If you followed the instructions in this assignment, the VehicleRegistrationService and TrafficControlService are still running.

1. Open the terminal window in VS Code in which the FineCollectionService was running.

1. Enter the following command to start the changed FineCollectionService again:

   ```console
   dapr run --app-id finecollectionservice --app-port 6001 --dapr-http-port 3601 --dapr-grpc-port 60001 dotnet run
   ```

The services are up & running. Now you're going to test this using the simulation.

1. Open a **new** terminal window in VS Code and change the current folder to `src/Simulation`.

1. Start the simulation:

   ```console
   dotnet run
   ```

You should see similar logging as before when you ran the application.

## Step 4: Use Dapr observability

So how can you check whether or not the call to the VehicleRegistrationService is handled by Dapr? Well, Dapr has some observability built in. You can look at Dapr traffic using Zipkin:

1. Open a browser and go the this URL: [http://localhost:9411/zipkin](http://localhost:9411/zipkin).

2. Click the `RUN QUERY` button in the top right of the screen to search for traces.

3. You should see the calls between the FineCollectionService and the VehicleRegistrationService. You can expand and collapse each trace and click the `SHOW` button to get more details:

4. If you click the dependencies button and search, you will see the services and the traffic flowing between them:
